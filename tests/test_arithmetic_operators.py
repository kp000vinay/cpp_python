# Test arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //

# Addition
sum = x + y
total = a + b + c

# Subtraction
diff = x - y
result = a - b - c

# Multiplication
product = x * y
result = a * b * c

# Division
quotient = x / y
result = a / b

# Modulo
remainder = x % y
mod = 10 % 3

# Power
power = x ** y
squared = x ** 2
cubed = x ** 3

# Floor division
floor_div = x // y
result = 10 // 3

# Combined operations
complex_expr = x + y * z
nested = (a + b) * (c - d)
power_chain = x ** y ** z

# Operator precedence
result1 = 2 + 3 * 4
result2 = (2 + 3) * 4
result3 = 2 ** 3 ** 2
